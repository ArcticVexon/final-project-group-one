Final Project Proposal.

Our micro-site proposal would focus on having more student art shown with the University of Kentuckyâ€™s Art Museum. We want to make it easier and less intimidating for students to submit their art in order to strengthen campus involvement. By having a form to easily submit art to the museum that is accessible and transparent to students. Along with the opportunity to submit personal art pieces there will be a gallery on the site with student art that has been submitted. Lastly to show our information on our proposal and how successful it will be there will be interviews that have been conducted of art students and their thoughts on whether or not they would like to have their art work submitted and why, along with non-art students to see how many would show up if their friend was going to have their art shown within the museum.

We want to propose to the museum how beneficial it would be to the museum and campus for student artwork to be shown within the museum.

To measure the success of our micro-site proposal we will ask students (both art and non-art students) on whether or not they would submit art and if they would come to the art show. By showing how easy the process would be to submit art, student feedback will show how successful this micro-site could be.

Once the proposal is approved we will launch this micro-site through various social media outlets, like Twitter and Facebook, where direct links to the form to submit student artwork will be found. Also the use of QR codes will be of great use, because by hanging the QR code around campus telling students in a simple and short way that they can submit their art to been shown in the Museum. We will also heavily promote that the museum is free to everyone so there is a greater chance of students who are proud of their work being shown.
